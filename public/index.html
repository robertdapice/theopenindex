          <h4>Each department's Open Index rates their commitment to transparency and open data.</h4>

          <h3>Open Data</h3>
          <h4>Departments should release data by third parties to enable novel services and insights.</h4>
          <p class='description'>TheOpenIndex rates government departments on their contribution to the <a href="http://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a>, and the new <a href="http://opendata.linkeddigital.com.au">data.gov.au beta</a>.</p>
          <p class='description'>Departments are scored on the number of their datasets available and the average hits per day, rating and votes for their datasets.</p>

          <h3>Financial Reporting</h3>
          <h4>Departments should report in detail where and how they spend their money.</h4>
          <p class='description'>TheOpenIndex uses data from <a href ="http://theopenbudget.org">TheOpenBudget</a> to analyse the level of detail each Portfolio provides in their Portfolio Budget Statements.</p>
          <p class='description'>Portfolios are scored based on how much of their total expenditure is reported in line items that are smaller than 15% of their total expenditure.</p>

          <h3>FOI Compliance</h3>
          <h4>Departments should respond to FOI requests within 30 days, as per their statutory obligations.</h4>
          <p class='description'>TheOpenIndex rates each department on the proportion of FOI requests that are not fulfilled within statutory timelines.</p>
          <p class='description'>Departments receive poorer scores based on both the percentage of FOI requests that are late, and the extent to which they are late. Personal FOI requests are excluded from the analysis.</p>

          <h3>Online Access</h3>
          <h4>Departments should provide quality online resources.</h4>
          <p class='description'>TheOpenIndex assesses each Department's web presence using three different factors: performance, accessibility, and twitter responsiveness.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website Performance is scored using the open source tool <a href="http://yslow.org">ySlow</a>.</li>
            <li>Accessibility is scored using the open source tool <a href="http://wave.webaim.org">WAVE</a>.</li>
            <li>Twitter Responsiveness is scored using the Twitter API to determine the number of hours it took for the department to respond to @mentions.</li>

          <h3>Overdue Questions-on-Notice</h3>
          <h4>Departments should respond to questions from the Senate.</h4>
          <p class='description'>TheOpenIndex assesses the number of questions from the Senate to each department that is overdue, ie have not been answered within 30 days.</p>
          <p class='description'>Departments with a larger number of overdue questions receive a lower score.</p>
